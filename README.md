# word_conditionalformatting
VBA code to implement conditional formatting with drop downs in word, specifically for RAG ratings.

First, create a table and drop down in boxes from control in the developer tab.

The code can be copied into VBE.

Where it says 'Option 1/2/3', change this to what your RAG options are.

After the VBA code is run, when you select the text from the drop down you create, the colour of the cell will change according to your RAG rating.
